Embed dynamic web charts and tables in your site! Connect to your live WordPress instance DB to retrieve data in real-time!

== Description ==
Adding charts and tables to your web site has never been that easy. WP Business Intelligence Lite is a WordPress plugin that transforms your WordPress platform in a reporting tool with charts and tables. 
The admin interface lets you create SQL queries to retrieve data from the DB. Once you have created at least one query that correctly retrieves data from your DB, you can define the type of chart (bar, (multi)line, pie) or table to be used to display them. A simple shortcode embeds the chart or table in any post or page. Each page refresh retrieves the data from the DB so that the information is always up-to-date.

WARNING: this plugin is the WP Business Intelligence core. In order to get full advantages from WP Business Intelligence, you can get WP Business Intelligence Pro or Enterprise together with the TinyMCE editor's extensions from the [WP Business Intelligence web site](http://www.wpbusinessintelligence.com)
