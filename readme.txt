Embed dynamic charts in your site. Connects to your WordPress instance DB to retrieve data.

== Description ==
WP Business Intelligence Lite is a WordPress plugin that transforms your WordPress platform in a reporting tool with charts and tables.
The admin interface lets you create SQL queries to retrieve data from the DB. Once you have your queries correctily retrieving the data you can define the type of chart (bar, (multi)line, pie) or table to  be used to display them. A simple shortcode embeds the chart or table in any post or page. Each page refresh retrieves the data from the DB so that the information is always up-to-date.
